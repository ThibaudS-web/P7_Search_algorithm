# P7_Search_algorithm

## Presentation 

For this project, a research algorithm is being implemented. The user has the possibility to filter recipes from the kitchen with a search bar and 3 differents filters (Filter by ingredients, appliances, and utensils).

## Project constraint

The search algorithm had to be coded with a method from the array methods and on another branch by native loops.
For this project, the chosen solution had to be the most efficient algorithm. 
It is the algorithm of the native loops that was chosen.

## Start the project

```
git clone https://github.com/ThibaudS-web/P7_Search_algorithm.git
```

## Choose your algorithm

### With natives loops

```
git checkout algo-nativeLoops
```

### With array methods

```
git checkout algo-arrayMethods
```

## Tools
